            <h2>Our Story: The Origin of Bag  store</h2>
        </div>

        <div class="story-content">
            <p>
                Welcome to [Your Store Name]! We believe a bag is much more than just a place to carry things—it's an essential tool and a statement piece that travels through life with you.
            </p>

            <div class="narrative-block">
                <p>
                    Our founder, [Founder's Name, optional], started this store in [Year] with a simple goal: to solve the everyday dilemma of needing a bag that is both reliably functional and effortlessly stylish. We noticed a gap in the market for carry solutions that truly merge durability, thoughtful organization, and premium design.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That passion led us to create a curated collection of bags, from minimalist totes to rugged travel packs, all designed to make your daily haul seamless and beautiful.
